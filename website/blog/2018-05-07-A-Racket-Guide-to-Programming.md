# About this site

This website was written in mind for a child with particular enthusiasm for math
and programming, and assumes an elementary algebra foundation that would benefit
from the modelling and visualization of problems.

The introduction of Racket is to see its potential firstly as a mathematical
companion tool, and only secondly as a gateway into interest in computation.
That is to say, this is not meant to teach application programming, but it's
most certainly not meant to conceptually or attitudinally exclude it in any way.

As the language on this website is a bit advanced and technical, it's advised 
that an adult guide the reading comprehension experience. I believe that 
wrestling with difficult language is unavoidable if a child is to progress 
towards self-sufficiency for technical learning, and eventually the adult must
exit the picture.

This also includes disciplined web usage, which I believe must be faciliated
through the gradual relaxation of web controls.

## Why Racket?

* I feel that young children are often stalled, population-wise, at particular
  points in math education which would benefit greatly from the "hands-on"
  manipulation of functions, data, and visualizations.

* I performed a survey of languages discussed for pedagogical contexts, as well
  as popular languages of industry, and I found that a common thread was that
  numbers weren't very "algebraic" in the sense that simple equations would risk
  breaking in unintuitive ways due to the underlying imprecise numeric
  representation.

  That `0.1` plus `0.2` fails to equal `0.3` is a default reality to all popular
  programming languages of industry and public pedagogy is a confusing
  distraction to young people. Sometime the subject of number representation
  must be broached, but Racket allows what I think is a healthy delay of that
  matter with exact rationals under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
  division. Racket even allows you to directly input fractions.

* Racket's ecosystem and existing libraries can satisfy most high school math
  needs, including visualization or graphing libraries.

* Racket comes with DrRacket, a decent tool for editing and running code.

* I felt that Racket (or Lisp) style prose might enable children to see algebra
  in a more conscious and string-like manner.
