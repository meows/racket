# Saving information

## `define`

### Values

Use `define` and save:
- a string behind the name `s`
- a number behind the name `n`
- a boolean behind the name `b`

### Functions

1. Define a function called `triangle-area` which can tell you the area of a 
   triangle based on two natural inputs, `base` and `height`.

2. Given this function definition in math:

```
f(0) = 5
f(n) = f(n-1) * 2
```

Rewrite it twice, once as a recursive function, another time as an exponential
function which generates a geometric sequence from the naturals.
