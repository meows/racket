# Racket Language (untyped)

## Expressions and sub-expressions

A Racket expression consists of a sequence of symbols and sub-expressions
separated by spaces and surrounded by parenthesis. This expression contains one
or more atoms, or if it's not an atom, then it's a sub-expression.


Observe the expression below:

``` clojure
; original statement
(- 4 (+ 1 1))

; the redex, which may be reduced to the value 2
(+ 1 1)

; the continuation, where [] represents the redex
(- 4 [])
```

## Binding to Variables

### Binding Functions or Procedures

``` clojure
(define (name arg-1 arg-2 arg-3 arg-n)
   (body "that is reducible to a value")
)

; more realistically,
(define (volume-of-prism x y z)
   (* x y z)
)

(volume-of-prism 3 4 5) ; -> 60

; or with an anonymous function / lambda:
(define volume-of-prism 
   (Î» (x y z) (* x y z))
)
```

### Binding Values or Reducible Expressions

``` clojure
(define pi 3.14)
pi -> 3.14
```

## Conditionals

``` clojure
(define neg-or-even )
```
