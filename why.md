## Racket for math and science

## Racket numbers are easier

Racket uses arbitrary precision integers and rationals by default. In exchange
for the performance penalty, early students can focus more on math and less on
the peculiarities of their underlying software tool. Most languages do the 
reverse -- by default they sacrifice mathematical ergonomics in exchange for 
speed.

## Racket comes with a decent IDE

Out of the box, Racket comes with an IDE called DrRacket, which can eliminate a
lot of pain with tooling, and provides the basics of code editing and insight
niceties.

## Racket has some upsides and downsides to usability as a language

### Pros:

* There is very little syntactically priviledged symbols, meaning there are very
  few symbols with meaning to memorize or learn.
* Lisp has a lot of parentheses, which can get in the way of reading.
* The library and software ecosystem is extensive, and the "official" libraries
  have good focus on math.
* Racket comes with a plotting library.
* Racket comes with a lot of the math operations and constants that young 
  students would be interested in.

### Cons:

* Community can be a bit small, and a lot of knowledge discussion goes
  undocumented over now-popular chat solutions, so finding help can be hard.
  Fortunately the community makes up for this by being very active, but I'm not
  sure how considerate it is to poll the attention of important core 
  contributors.
* Documentation can be quite sparse on examples.
* Few official books for Racket.
