# Installation & Setup

This guide covers the Racket programming language (version 6.12+). The main
installation method should come with a code editor and programming environment
called DrRacket.

## Quick Start

* After installation, create a new folder that will serve as a place to hold 
  your Racket project files.
* Open DrRacket, and for the first time only you will be asked to choose a
  language.
* After you type some valid Racket code, such as `(+ 1 2 3)`, you can then save
  the file, such as with `<ctrl>-s`
* Then run the file with `<ctrl>-r`.
* You can also run your Racket program, which should have a name ending with
  `.rkt`, from the command line with `racket your-filename.rkt`.
