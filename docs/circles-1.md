# Circles and Angles

By now we should be comfortable with the idea that `π` is the ratio between a
circle's _circumference_ and its _diameter_. We should also be comfortable with
the idea that if the radius of a circle is `1`, then the perimeter is `2π`.

## Angles

An angle is like a unit of measurement which asks how long you walk along a
circle's perimeter. If the unit of measurement is longer than a circle, that 
just means to walk around the circle more than once. If the unit of measurement
is negative, that just means to walk in the opposite direction.

radians  | degrees | direction | walk around a circle | factor
-------  | ------- | --------- | -------------------- | ------
`4π`     |  720°   | forward   | twice                | 2
`2π`     |  360°   | forward   | once                 | 1
`π`      |  180°   | forward   | halfway              | 1/2
`π/2`    |  90°    | forward   | quarterway           | 1/4
`0π`     |  0°     | none      | no walking           | 0
`-π/2`   | -90°    | backward  | quarterway           | -1/4
`-π`     | -180°   | backward  | halfway              | -1/2
`-2π`    | -360°   | backward  | once                 | -1
`-4π`    | -720°   | backward  | twice                | -2

The `factor` column represents how many times you want to walk around the
circle, but in numerical form, where a factor of `1` means to walk around the
circle once. You might observe from this table that you need merely 
_double the factor to get the radians_. Strangely, there are countless students
around the world still memorizing the radians!

## Review

Without referring to the table or calculating very much, try to answer the
following questions using only your mind.

* If I want to go forward `1/3` of the way around a circle, how many radians and degrees is that?
* If I want to go forward `1/6` of the way around a circle, how many radians and degrees is that?
* If I want to go forward `1/360` of the way around a circle, how many radians and degrees is that?
* If I want to go backward `1/4` of the way around a circle, how many radians and degrees is that?
* If I want to go backward `2/4` of the way around a circle, how many radians and degrees is that?
* If I want to go backward `4/4` of the way around a circle, how many radians and degrees is that?
