# Circles and Triangles

> WIP. Do not use.

When people talk about circles and triangles, including terms like pi, a lot of 
times people know what you mean, but in math and science, it's important to get 
your definitions very accurate, and so we will begin by re-defining what a 
circle means.

* A circle is defined first by finding a single center point **`O`** on a flat 
  plane or surface, and then finding all the points which are exactly some 
  _radius_ or distance **`R`** away from that center point.

* The longest straight line across the center of the circle is **`D`**, for
  _diameter_, and it happens to be double the radius.

* The length of the circle is represented by **`C`**, the _circumference_.

## Pi ― _not the delicious kind_

Pi, also written as `π`, is the 16th letter in the Greek alphabet. `π` is a 
famous number in our society which many know simply as `3.14`; some are aware 
that more numbers come after, but what is `π`? Is it just a bunch of numbers
that people memorize?

As it happens, many people are also already aware of how to calculate the 
circumference of a circle, which is just `π` multiplied by the diameter. If you
take the formula `C = π * D`, and you divide both sides by `D`, you'll end up
with:

`π = C / D`

From here we can see that `π` is merely the ratio of the circumference to the 
diameter, or `C` divided by `D`. As it happens, the ratio of `C:D` is the 
_same for all circles ever_, which is what makes `π` so useful.

## Questions to review

* What's the definition of a circle?
* What's _radius_?
* What's _diameter_?
* What's _circumference_?
* What's the definition of `π`?
