# Systems of Linear Equations

Alice and Bob are planning to meet each other somewhere along El Camino Real.
Bob starts 100 miles away from Alice, and starts driving 50 miles per hour
towards Alice. Alice also starts driving towards Bob at the same time, but she's
going 40 miles per hour.

When will they meet in the middle?
