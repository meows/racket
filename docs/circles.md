# Circles

When people talk about circles and triangles, including terms like pi, a lot of
times people know what you mean, but in math and science, it's important to get
your definitions very accurate, and so we will begin by re-defining what a
circle means.

* A circle is defined by finding a single center point **`O`** on a flat plane 
  or surface, and then finding all the points which are exactly some _radius_ or 
  distance **`R`** away from that center point.

* The longest straight line across the center of the circle is **`D`**, for
  _diameter_, and it happens to be double the radius.

* The length of the circle is represented by **`C`**, the _circumference_.

## Pi ― _not the delicious kind_

Pi, also written as `π`, is the 16th letter in the Greek alphabet. `π` is a
famous number in our society which many know simply as `3.14`; some are aware
that more numbers come after, but what is `π`? Is it just a bunch of numbers
that people memorize?

You may already be aware of how to calculate the circumference of a circle,
which is just `π` multiplied by the diameter. If you take the formula
`C = π * D`, and you divide both sides by `D`, you'll end up with:

`π = C / D`

From here we can see that `π` is merely the ratio of the circumference to the
diameter, or `C` divided by `D`. As it happens, the ratio of `C:D` is the _same
for all circles ever_, which is what makes `π` so useful.

## Radians

If the circumference of a circle can be calculated by `π * diameter`, and the
radius of the circle is `1`, then the diameter will be `2`, and the
circumference will be `2π`.

A **radian** is a unit of measurement that makes use of `π` to describe angles.
If a full circle is `2π` radians or 360°, then a half circle is `π` radians or 
180°. Here are some more examples below:

radians | factor  | degrees
------- | ------- | -------
`4π`    | 4       | 720°
`2π`    | 2       | 360°
`π`     | 1       | 180°
`π/2`   | 1/2     | 90°
`π/4`   | 1/4     | 45°
`π/6`   | 1/6     | 30°
`π/12`  | 1/12    | 15°
`π/36`  | 1/36    | 5°
`π/180` | 1/180   | 1°

> Don't memorize the radians, as we'll learn a trick about them later.

## Why Radians? Or Degrees?

Mathematicians and physicists frequently, or almost entirely use radians instead
of degrees to measure angles. Part of the reason for this preference is because
while `π` has a lot of deep connections in math, nobody really knows why we
chose to divide a circle into 360 degrees.

One theory is that the Persian calendar used to have 360 days in a year. Another
possibility is that 360 works nicely in a base 60 number system, which was used
by the Babylonians. Unfortunately the reason has long been lost in history.

## Questions to review

* What's the definition of a circle?
* What's _radius_?
* What's _diameter_?
* What's _circumference_?
* What's the definition of `π` in terms of diameter and circumference?
* What's a 270° angle in radians?
* What's `3π` radians in degrees?
