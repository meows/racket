# Circles

> WIP. Do not use.

When people talk about circles and triangles, including terms like pi, a lot of 
times people know what you mean, but in math and science, it's important to get 
your definitions very accurate, and so we will begin by re-defining what a 
circle means.

* A circle is defined first by finding a single center point **`O`** on a flat 
  plane or surface, and then finding all the points which are exactly some 
  _radius_ or distance **`R`** away from that center point.

* The longest straight line across the center of the circle is **`D`**, for
  _diameter_, and it happens to be double the radius.

* The length of the circle is represented by **`C`**, the _circumference_.

## Pi ― _not the delicious kind_

Pi, also written as `π`, is the 16th letter in the Greek alphabet. `π` is a 
famous number in our society which many know simply as `3.14`; some are aware 
that more numbers come after, but what is `π`? Is it just a bunch of numbers
that people memorize?

You may already be aware of how to calculate the circumference of a circle, 
which is just `π` multiplied by the diameter. If you take the formula 
`C = π * D`, and you divide both sides by `D`, you'll end up with:

`π = C / D`

From here we can see that `π` is merely the ratio of the circumference to the 
diameter, or `C` divided by `D`. As it happens, the ratio of `C:D` is the 
_same for all circles ever_, which is what makes `π` so useful.

## Radians

If the circumference of a circle can be calculated by `π * diameter`, and the
radius of the circle is `1`, then the circumference is `2π`. A **radian** is a
unit of measurement that makes use of `π` to describe angles. If a full circle
is `2π`, then a half circle is `π`, and 90° is `π/2`.

Mathematicians and
physicists frequently, or almost entirely use radians instead of degrees to 
measure angles.

Part of the reason for this preference is because while `π` has a lot of deep 
connections in math, nobody really knows why we chose to divide a circle into 
360 degrees. 

One theory is that the Persian calendar used to have 360 days in a year. Another
possibility is that 360 works nicely in a base 60 number system, which was used 
by the Babylonians. Unfortunately the reason has long been lost in history.

## Questions to review

* What's the definition of a circle?
* What's _radius_?
* What's _diameter_?
* What's _circumference_?
* What's the definition of `π` in terms of diameter and circumference?
* What's a 30° angle in radians?
* What's a 180° angle in radians?
