# Data Structures

> Make sure you've read about [types and values](values.md) before proceeding.

By now we should be familiar with the idea that we can group values, such as:

``` clojure
;; these are all numbers
2323
45
100
123141

;; these are all strings
"2314"
"Hi"
" food is today "
"2 + 2 = 4"

;; these are all booleans
true
false
#t
#f
```
