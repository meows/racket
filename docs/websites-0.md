# What happens when you type in a URL?

For example, when you go to `rid.pw` in your browser, you know that information
can pop straight into your browser tab or window. But how? You know that the 
information was likely not there before, so this information had to from afar,
from somewhere "over the web", which is another way of saying a bunch of 
computers connected to each other.

Here's another part of the question. Let's consider the well known company 
called Google, which owns `google.com`. Did you know that Google could sell
`google.com` to me if it wanted? Maybe one day they want to rename themselves
completely to Alphabet.

So if it's possible for different people to own `google.com` at different times,
how does your browser know "where to go"?

As it happens, the internet actually has a way of making sure that every device
that connects to the network has a unique address, just like your home address,
and it's called an **IP address**, where IP stands for _internet protocol_.

We live in complicated times, and right now there are two kinds of IP addresses,
version 4 and 6, and they're called IPv4 and IPv6. The IPv4 is the most common
address today, but the whole world is slowly changing over IPv6 because we're
running out of IPv4 addresses!

An IPv4 address looks like: 

107.130.102.149

And it can range from `0.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`.

As you can see, there are 4 slots that allow a 3-digit number, allowing for 12
numbers total. That's 12 to the power of 10 possible internet addresses, or
61,917,364,224. The actual number of IP addresses available for public use is
actually just a bit lower than that because many of those addresses are being
used up by government or other important organizations.
