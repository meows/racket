# Dimensional Exercise

Have you ever heard the term 3D, or 3-dimensional? Some people say that the
world is spatially 3D, but what does that mean? One possibility is that they
mean if you wanted to meet with somebody, you needed to know at least three
_coordinates_.

Let's say a coordinate is a piece of information which you can represent with a
single integer or real number. If so, you can also imagine then that a
coordinate can be represented as a point on a number line.

You can also imagine that we can use a coordinate `x` to represent length, `y`
to represent height, and `z` to represent depth. If you were trying to program a
drone, it would only require these 3 pieces of information to successfully 
follow someone in 3D space.

But you might have also heard of the idea of 4-dimensional space, or even higher
dimensions. What does that mean? For example, if a circle is defined as the set
of all points equidistant from a center point, what would a 4D circle look like?
