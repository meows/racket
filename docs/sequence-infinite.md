# The Science of Sequences

A sequence is a collection of stuff which can be counted. Some sequences are
finite, whereas other sequences are ongoing. We can define a sequence with this
notation:

   $$(2^{-n})_{n=1}^{\infty} = \frac{1}{2} → \frac{1}{4} → \frac{1}{8} → ...$$

Notes:

1. $(2^{-n})$ is the expression or function to be evaluated.
2. $n=1$ is the starting value for $n$; there can be more variables.
3. $\infty$ is the stopping point for the sequence. In this case there's no stopping point.

A series is a process which sums a sequence.

$$S = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + ...$$


* $S_1 = \dfrac{1}{2}$

* $S_2 = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4}$

* $S_3 = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{1}{8}$
