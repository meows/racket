##   Sequence

A sequence means a "line" of separate things positioned one after another, which you can count using the counting numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4...). So of course, the counting numbers themselves form a sequence:

`0` → `1` → `2` → `...` → `8` → `9` → `10`

People often recite the English alphabet as a sequence:

`a` → `b` → `c` → `...` → `x` → `y` → `z`

Days of the week form a sequence:

`Monday` → `Tuesday` → `Wednesday` → `Thursday` → `Friday` → `Saturday` → `Sunday`

But only anything you can count is a sequence! Some things in life don't naturally form a sequence, but if you can find a way to count them, then you can turn them into a sequence; for example, people waiting in line, or players on a basketball team:

### Golden State Warriors - Roster 2017

 | sequence number | original | player
 | --------------- | -------- | ------
 |  0              |  0       | Patrick McCaw
 |  1              |  1       | JaVale McGee
 |  2              |  2       | Jordan Bell
 |  3              |  3       | David West
 |  4              |  4       | Quinn Cook
 |  5              |  5       | Kevon Looney
 |  6              |  6       | Nick Young
 |  7              | 11       | Klay Thompson
 |  8              | 15       | Damian Jones
 |  9              | 18       | Omri Casspi
 | 10              | 23       | Draymond Green
 | 11              | 25       | Chris Boucher
 | 12              | 27       | Zaza Pachulia
 | 13              | 30       | Stephen Curry
 | 14              | 34       | Shaun Livingston
 | 15              | 35       | Kevin Durant

Even a list of words surrounded by parenthesis:

`(hello there i am surrounded by parenthesis)`

| list position | word / atom
| ------------- | ----
| 0             | hello
| 1             | there
| 2             | i
| 3             | am
| 4             | surrounded  
| 5             | by
| 6             | parenthesis

> Note that by coincidence we start counting from 0 here. Sometimes it's easier to count from 0, and sometimes it's easier to count from 1, but mathematicians, physicists, and engineers typically count from 0.
