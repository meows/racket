# Sets

A set is an extremely important idea in mathematics, so important and flexible
that it's used as the common language of mathematics. A set is also important
for a better definition of functions.

A set is a collection of 0 or more things which are unique. In math, if we
wanted to write down the set of unique naturals from `0..4`, we'd write:

`{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }`

Notice that I said a set can have 0 or more unique things. This implies that we
can always ask how many things are inside the set, whether it's 0 or more. We
cannot have negative items in a set, just like, metaphorically speaking, we
cannot have negative items in a bag.

In the example above, we had a set of things that could be considered a set
with some natural numbers inside. In math you will likely encounter many more
sets that deal with other kinds of mathematical objects, but you can actually
have sets of just about anything, as long as you follow the rule of uniqueness
and countability:

`{ cat, dog, banana, 4 }`

A set can even have sets inside; try to count how many items are in each set:

```
{ } 

{ 0 }

{ 0, 
  {0}
}

{ 0, 
  {0}, 
  {0, {0}}
}

{ 0, 
  {0}, 
  {0, {0}},
  {0, {0}, {0, {0}}} 
}
```

## Redefining the function

I've mentioned before that a function is a mathematical machine which, for every
input, it will give back one output. We will refine that definition further. A
function takes any item in a set and returns one thing. The input set is called
a **domain**, and the output is called the **codomain**.

## Sets in Racket

A set in Racket is like a list except that all its members must be unique. Any
redundant members will be removed by Racket's set.

``` clojure
(set 1 2 3 3 4 5 5) ;; â†’ (set 1 2 3 4 5)
```

`set?`
`subset?`
`set-add`
`set-remove`
`set-clear`
