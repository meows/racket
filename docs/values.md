## Values

Just about all programming languages allow you to take information in some way, 
save it, find it again, and perhaps later change it in some useful way. If
computers were only allowed to save information, that would merely make them
excellent alternatives to paper.

But first, let's talk about information. Information means anything you know to
be true about the world. Unfortunately, the information in your head stays
locked up until you can find a way to get it out, either by telling somebody, or
by writing it down.

When you write things down in English, you might scribble a bunch of things that
look like:

> Man tror att algebra och datorer är djupt anslutna.

Oh oops, that's Swedish. Even if you don't know all the words in English, you
can still spot that at least one of the letters aren't normal: `ä`. Just like
English has acceptable letters you're allowed to use to make up new words, so to
do programming languages have acceptable symbols you're allowed to use.
