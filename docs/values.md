## Values

Just about all programming languages allow you to take information in some way, 
save it, find it again, and perhaps later change it in some useful way. Any bit
of information that you're allowed to write down is called a value. `23` is a
value which happens to be a number. `"Meow Mix is too delicious."` is a value
which happens to be a *string*.

### Booleans

### Numbers

### Strings
