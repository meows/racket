# Geometric Sequences

Recall that a [sequence](sequence.md) is a list of "things" in order, one after 
another, which can be counted by the natural numbers.

We have seen sequences before like these:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60...
30, 20, 10, 0, -10, -20...

These sequence all have something in common in that their *velocity* never 
changes. We call these *linear* sequences because if we were to graph these
points and connect them, they would look like a straight line.

These sequences can be defined by:

f(x) = a*x + b

Where `f` is the function that can give the sequence, `x` is the natural input
that we expect, `a` is the velocity, and `b` is the starting position of the
sequence.

We have also seen sequences like:

0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21...
0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36...
0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216...

What these sequences have in common is that their velocity changes. Fortunately,
their velocity changes in a very stable way, which we discover by diffing it.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...
1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91...
6, 12, 18, 30, 36, 42...

## A sequence that diffing has trouble with

2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64...
