# A little journey into Racket

We're about to embark on a journey into a language called Racket. Racket is an
extremely simple language, and it likely won't be your last programming language
if you continue onward in math or science. Many people who continue on in 
software may learn many languages.

What people do later with programming is often not about software or programming
itself, but rather what you can do with it. 

* A statistician is a kind of mathematician who studies data and uses 
  mathematical techniques to understand and perhaps even justify a prediction 
  about the future. Programming allows a statistician to pull data from so many
  places, and then run quick and private experiments that normally would've cost
  a fortune.

* People are exploring whether software and hardware can successfully copy bits
  of human learning, or just thinking in general -- also known as artificial
  intelligence. Google recently held a competitive match in a board game called 
  Go, famous for the fact that despite its simplicity, humans could still beat
  the best computers. Even though Go's rules are so simple, it's thought that
  there are over 10 to the power of 300 possible games, which makes made it
  unreasonable for even the best computers to solve or calculate through an 
  entire game.

  Google's program, AlphaGo, was famous for the fact that it wasn't actually 
  taught any strategies, or even the rules of the game, instead learning all by 
  playing itself billions of times over. Last year in 2017, Google's team beat 
  the world's best player, Ke Jie.

  This kind of technology no longer requires the world's best scientists. Some
  people are using this technology in simple ways to see, for example, whether
  lighter or darker backgrounds and colors make it easier for your eyes to read,
  just by having people vote, and then learning to adjust slowly over time.
  Imagine a website that learns from its visitors to slowly adjust itself over
  time to become more readable!

* Although the activity is considered controversial, it's also well known that
  much of the stocks (ways to buy parts of companies to make more money later) 
  being traded today are done automatically by computers, at dizzyingly inhuman 
  speeds. Sometimes, companies write programs that battle other rival programs 
  when buying stocks.

* A mathematician normally does his or her work by absolute proofs, and not by
  experiments. When a mathematician says "proof", they mean something far more
  strict than what a scientist means. A mathematician means that if you follow
  their rules, their conclusion will be 100% perfect.

  But mathematicians are finding that quick and nearly-free experiments in math,
  even though not nearly as powerful as a mathematical proof, can provide new
  ideas or insights they might not have ordinarily obtained.

* Some mathematicians are also exploring the world of using computer languages
  to describe their mathematical theories so that the computer can prove ideas 
  for them! This is called Automated Theorem Proving.

* One interesting aspect of programming is working with other people, some like
  yourself who have started early, and some in high school, and some in
  college, and many beyond. You get to trade ideas with smart people you've
  never met, and you get to build things together that are new and powerful,
  things that other people will want to use and build upon. There is a world of 
  software where people build cities upon each other.

This is just a very small piece of what people are accomplishing with math and
computing together. People don't just do software. They combine it with things
to make it alive, sometimes quite literally, like a car that drives without a
driver. We used to call cars "horseless carriages". Maybe soon you'll be calling
them "driverless cars".
