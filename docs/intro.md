# A little journey into Racket

We're about to embark on a journey into a language called Racket. Racket is an
extremely simple language, and it likely won't be your last programming language
if you continue onward in math or science. Many people who continue on in 
software may learn many languages.

What people do later with programming is often not about software or programming
itself, but rather what you can do with it. 

* A statistician is a kind of mathematician who studies data and uses 
  mathematical techniques to understand and perhaps even justify a prediction 
  about the future. Programming allows a statistician to pull data from so many
  places, and then run quick and private experiments that normally would've cost
  a fortune.

* People are exploring whether software and hardware can successfully copy bits
  of human learning, or just thinking in general -- also known as artificial
  intelligence. Google recently held a competitive match in a board game called 
  Go, famous for the fact that despite its simplicity, humans could still beat
  the best computers. 
  
  Google's program, AlphaGo, was famous for the fact that it wasn't actually 
  taught any strategies, or even the rules of the game, instead learning all by 
  playing itself billions of times over. Last year in 2017, Google's team beat 
  the world's best player, Ke Jie.

* Although the activity is considered controversial, it's also well known that
  much of the stocks (ways to buy parts of companies to make more money later) 
  being traded today are done automatically by computers, at dizzyingly inhuman 
  speeds. Sometimes, companies write programs that battle other programs when
  buying stocks.

* A mathematician normally does his or her work by absolute proofs, and not by
  experiments. When a mathematician says "proof", they mean something far more
  strict than what a scientist means. A mathematician means that if you follow
  their rules, their conclusion will be 100% perfect.

  But mathematicians are finding that quick and nearly-free experiments in math,
  even though not nearly as powerful as a mathematical proof, can provide new
  ideas or insights they might not have ordinarily obtained.

* Some mathematicians are also exploring the world of using computer languages
  to describe their mathematical theories so that the computer can prove ideas 
  for them! This is called Automated Theorem Proving.

This is just a very small piece of what people are accomplishing with math and
computing together. People don't just do software. They combine it with things
to make it alive, sometimes quite literally, like a car that drives without a
driver. We used to call cars "horseless carriages". Maybe soon you'll be calling
them "driverless cars".
