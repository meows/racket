# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the world's most popular languages, and it's what allows
companies like Google to make interesting websites like Google Maps, Gmail,
and other web "apps". JavaScript is also showing up as phone apps, and on just
about anything that's connected to the web.

## There's a hiccup

Although JavaScript is a powerful programming language, just as powerful as any
other, when JavaScript is run over the browser, such as when you visit a
website, you are also required to learn 2 other very small languages, namely
HTML and CSS. That may sound scary, but I assure you that those languages are
very small, and that you only need to learn a small amount to get up and going.
Most people don't learn these languages fully, and instead invest more time into
JavaScript.

## The first hiccup is HTML

When you visit a website, such as this one, you might see some different things,
such as information delivered as:
 - text
 - pictures
 - sound
 - video

All information on a website is contained in HTML (with very few and silly 
exceptions). I'm going to show you a very long sample of HTML, but I think 
you'll somehow find it familiar.
