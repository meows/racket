# Angles and Velocity

We previously learned that angle is like asking how far you want to walk along a
circle. You may have also heard before that an angle is what happens when two
lines intersect.

These two definitions don't exactly sound alike, especially circles don't have 
the kind of sharp "edges" that many angles have. But when you take two 
intersecting lines, and you draw a circle right at the center of that 
intersection, then the lines will end up slicing up a region of that circle's
perimeter. What percentage of circle is taken up by the intersecting lines will
always be the same no matter how big or small the circle is.
