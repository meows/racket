## Operations in Math

You may have heard the term "operations" or "operators" in math. If not, they
look like `+`, `-`, `ร`, and `รท`. An operator is just a function that gets 
special privilege of looking visually different. Even the equal sign `=` can be
considered an operator.

## In Racket, there are no operators

Hooray! In Racket, unless you are doing something unusual, we always put the
function in front so we don't have to think about order of operations as much.
