#   Alphabet

An alphabet means all the different of kinds symbols you're allowed to write 
down. For example, the English alphabet has 26 symbols called letters (if we 
don't consider capitalization):

`a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z`

How about `λ`? Oops, that's not an English character. Or how about `アロホモラ`? 
Most people accept that these aren't English characters, so we don't build 
English words or sentences out of these.

In math, depending on what level you are at, your alphabet might only include 
zero and the positive numbers, along with some funny symbols:

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + =`

Later on, you might learn about the negative numbers too, so your math alphabet 
expands, and now you're allowed to work with problems and equations with symbols
that look like:

`-9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + - × ÷ =`

Eventually, your math alphabet may even expand to see such symbols like:

`π i ℝ ℤ Δ λ`

If it's a symbol you're allowed to write down, then it's a part of our alphabet. 
If you're feeling that this is lacking in a strong reason in science or nature 
-- it's true. Something is in our alphabet just because we say so. But at some 
point people have to agree on an alphabet in order to communicate easily, or 
else we'd be disagreeing on the *small* things, such as what words to use, 
instead of talking about the *big* things, like interesting ideas.
