# Installing Racket

Before we begin the lessons, we must first download some programs to help us run
our Racket program. Click the installation link below which matches your current
operating system.

* [Windows Installation](https://mirror.racket-lang.org/installers/6.12/racket-6.12-x86_64-win32.exe)
* [MacOS Installation](https://mirror.racket-lang.org/installers/6.12/racket-6.12-x86_64-macosx.dmg)
* [Other Systems](https://download.racket-lang.org/)

After downloading and running the installation, we should now have a program
called DrRacket on our computer.
