# Geometry Test

Give a definition for a circle.

* A circle is the set of all points on a 2D plane which are equidistant from a
  center point.

Give a definition for $π$ using the term _ratio_.

* π is the ratio between a circle's perimeter and its diameter.

Give a definition for the unit circle.

A unit circle is a way of measuring degrees based on a circle with a radius of 
$1$ unit. In such a case, travel around a full circle is given by the formula 
for a circle's circumference: $circumference = diameter * π$. If we fill in the 
blanks for diameter, we get $2π$.

Give a definition of angle in terms of intersecting lines, and explain why that
could have any relationship with a circle.

* An angle represents the percentage you wish to travel along a circle's 
  perimeter.

From what direction do we start measuring either positive or negative angles?

* Positive is counterclockwise, negative is opposite.

Give the definition of a unit circle, and explain how one might convert between:
  - degrees
  - radians
  - percentage of a circle

## Applied Word Problems

Which of these are false? (select none to all)
- a radius is half a diameter
- the diameter is the longest possible line segment in a circle
- the diameter always intersects the center of the circle
