<p>We're about to embark on a journey into a language called Racket. Racket is an
extremely simple language, and it likely won't be your last programming language
if you continue onward in math or science. Many people who continue on in
software may learn many languages.</p>
<p>What people do later with programming is often not about software or programming
itself, but rather what you can do with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A statistician is a kind of mathematician who studies data and uses
mathematical techniques to understand and perhaps even justify a prediction
about the future. Programming allows a statistician to pull data from so many
places, and then run quick and private experiments that normally would've cost
a fortune.</p></li>
<li><p>People are exploring whether software and hardware can successfully copy bits
of human learning or just thinking in general, in a subject known as
artificial intelligence. Google recently held a competitive match in a board
game called Go, famous for the fact that despite its simplicity, humans could
still beat the best computers. Even though Go's rules are so simple, it's
thought that there are over 10 to the power of 300 possible games, which made
it unreasonable for even the best computers to solve or calculate through an
entire game.</p>
<p>Google's program, AlphaGo, was famous for the fact that it wasn't actually
taught any strategies at all, or even the rules of the game, instead learning
all by playing itself billions of times over. Last year in 2017, AlphaGo beat
the world's best player, Ke Jie.</p>
<p>This kind of technology no longer requires the world's best scientists. Some
people are using this technology in simple ways, for example, to test whether
lighter or darker colors with text make it easier for your eyes to read on
websites. This can allow engineers to make websites that automatically adapt
to its visitors over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the activity is considered controversial, it's also well known that
much of the stocks (ways to buy parts of companies to make more money later)
being traded today are done automatically by computers, at dizzyingly inhuman
speeds. Sometimes, companies write programs that battle other rival programs
when buying stocks.</p></li>
<li><p>A mathematician normally does his or her work by absolute proofs, and not by
experiments. When a mathematician says &quot;proof&quot;, they mean something far more
strict than what a scientist means. A mathematician means that if you follow
their rules, their conclusion will be 100% perfect.</p>
<p>But mathematicians are finding that quick and nearly-free experiments in math,
even though not nearly as powerful as a mathematical proof, can provide new
ideas or insights they might not have ordinarily obtained.</p></li>
<li><p>Some mathematicians are also exploring the world of using computer languages
to describe their mathematical theories so that the computer can prove ideas
for them! This is called Automated Theorem Proving.</p></li>
<li><p>One interesting aspect of programming is working with other people, some like
yourself who have started early, some in high school, some in college, and
many beyond. You get to trade ideas with other interesting people, and you get
to build things together that are new and powerful, things that other people
will want to use and build upon.</p>
<p>There is a world of software where people build cities upon each other.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a very small piece of what people are accomplishing with math and
computing together. People don't just do software. They combine it with things
to make it alive, sometimes quite literally, like a car that drives without a
driver. We used to call cars &quot;horseless carriages&quot;. Maybe soon you'll be calling
them &quot;driverless cars&quot;.</p>
