# Atom

An atom means a [sequence](sequence.md) of any symbols from your [alphabet](alphabet.md). 
In a sense atoms are like words, or words that we're allowed to make up using 
our alphabet. For example, let's say that our alphabet only allows the letters 
`a...z`. Here are some example atoms using our rule:
 * `a`
 * `b`
 * `c`
 * `dog`
 * `eagle`
 * `zzzfrancezzz`

Or, if we are allowed to use other symbols like `$ # @ $ © = -`, we might create
atoms like:
 * `===-===`
 * `#el@lo$`
 * `©@$#`

However, as a special rule, I need to make a few complicating exceptions:
 * Brackets and parenthesis like `( )` can't be freely used *yet*, because we 
   use this as a special symbol to create lists.
 * `"` is used to create strings, like `"hello there"`
 * `#` this is special and will be discussed later.
 * `'` this is special and will be discussed later.
 * `.` this is special and will be discussed later.
 * There will a be a few more exceptions I'll make to you later down the line,
   but not much more.

Other than that, feel free to make up new names, words, or *atoms*, as you
please. `is-this-a-prime-number?` is a valid name in Racket if you want to use 
that, although that's probably a little long.
