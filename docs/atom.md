# Atom

An atom means a *sequence* of any symbols from your alphabet (some people call
this a "string", but we will save that word for later). In a sense they are like
words. For example, let's say that our alphabet only allows the letters `a...z`. 
Here are some example atoms using our rule:

  * `a`
  * `b`
  * `c`
  * `dog`
  * `eagle`
  * `zzzfrancezzz`

Or, if we are allowed to use other symbols like `$ # @ $ © = -`, we might create
atoms like:

  * `===-===`
  * `#el@lo$`
  * `©@$#`

However, as a special rule, parenthesis like `( )` can't be freely used *yet*. 
That's because we use this as a special symbol to create lists.
