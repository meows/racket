# Irrationality

## Irrationality of $x^2 = 2$

We write $x$ in the form of a fraction, where $\{ a, b \} ∈ ℕ^+$:

1. $x = \dfrac{a}{b}$ 
   
> We exclude $0$ and negative numbers because $0^2 = 0$ and $-x^2$ must be 
> positive.

1. $(\dfrac{a}{b})^2 = 2$

2. $\dfrac{a^2}{b^2} = 2$

3. $a^2 = 2b^2$

Here we can infer that $a^2$ must be an even number, because it's equal to a
natural multiplied by 2.
