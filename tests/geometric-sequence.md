## Series

1. What is a geometric series?

2. Recall and justify the formula to find sum of a geometric series.

## Applied

Find the sum $S$ of of the following geometric sequences:

$S = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{1}{8} + ...$

$S = 1 + \dfrac{2}{3} + \dfrac{4}{9} + \dfrac{8}{27} + ...$

$S = \dfrac{1}{10} + \dfrac{1}{100} + \dfrac{1}{1000} + ...$

$S = \dfrac{9}{10} + \dfrac{9}{100} + \dfrac{9}{1000} + ...$
