## `define`

### Values

Use `define` and save:
- a string behind the name `s`
- a number behind the name `n`

### Functions

1. Define a function called `triangle-area` which can tell you the area of a 
   triangle based on two natural inputs, `base` and `height`.

2. Given this function $f$ on any natural $n$:
   * $f(0) = 5$
   * $f(n) = f(n-1) * 2$

Rewrite this as a Racket function.
