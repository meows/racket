1. Tim is observing the rate at which bacteria multiply and he recorded some of
   his measurements in the table below:

   Day | Count
   --- | -----
   0   | 1
   1   | 2
   2   | 4
   3   | 8
   4   | 16
   5   | 32
   6   | 64
   7   | 128

   (a) Assuming the pattern continues, write a function $count$ which can
       approximate the bacterial count based on what day $d$ it is.

   (b) What's the minimum number of days it will take for the colony to reach a
       count of one million bacteria?
