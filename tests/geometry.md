# Geometry

## Terminology

1. Define a _circle_.
2. Define $π$ as a ratio.
3. Define the _unit circle_.
4. Give a definition for _angle_.

### Trigonometry

Define the following functions as a ratio of sides on a right triangle:

1. $sine =$
2. $cosine =$
3. $tangent =$

## Abstract Mastery

1. $sin(θ)^2 + cos(θ)^2 =$

2. $\dfrac{sin(θ)}{cos(θ)} =$

## Rote Practice

Fill in the missing entries for the `Degrees` and `Turns` columns, where a 
single turn means to go around the circle once, and a half-turn means to go 
halfway around a circle.

Radians         | Degrees | Turns
-------         | ------- | -----
$2π$            |         |
$π$             |         |
$\frac{1}{2} π$ |         |
$\frac{1}{4} π$ |         |
$\frac{1}{6} π$ |         |
$\frac{1}{8} π$ |         |

Try to predict what value would come out:

> Recall that a 30-60-90 degree triangle has a peculiar ratio of sides.

$tan(\frac{1}{4} π) =$

$sin(\frac{1}{6} π) =$

$cos(\frac{2}{6} π) =$

## Word Problems

> Leave the answer in terms of $sine$, $cosine$, or $tangent$. Alternatively,
> you can use the functions in Racket and round to the nearest hundredth place.

1. A 10 meter ladder is leaning against the wall. If the ladder forms an angle 
   of $\frac{1}{6} π$ with the ground, then what's the vertical height of the 
   ladder? What's the horizontal distance of the ladder?

2. Bob is trying to measure the height of a tall building. He walks about 20 
   meters away from the building and points a laser from the ground to edge of 
   the building's roof at an angle of $\frac{1}{3} π$. How tall is the building?

3. A drone is hovering 100 meters over flat desert ground. The drone spots a 
   campsite some distance away, and uses a laser to point at it. If the laser 
   forms a -60° angle from the horizontal plane in the sky, then how far away is 
   the campsite?

4. Alice is hiking up a trail with a slope of $\frac{1}{4} π$ from the ground. 
   If she's hiking at 10 meters per minute, then about how far up will she go in 
   10 minutes?
