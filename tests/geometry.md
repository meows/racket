# Geometry

## Terminology

1. Define a circle.
2. Define $π$ as a ratio.
3. Define the unit circle.

### Trigonometry

1. Define $sine$ as a ratio.
2. Define $cosine$ as a ratio.
3. Define $tangent$ as a ratio.

## Abstract Mastery

$sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2$

$\dfrac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}$ 

## Word Problems

> Leave the answer in terms of $sine$, $cosine$, or $tangent$. Alternatively,
> you can use the functions in Racket and round to the nearest hundredth place.

1. A 10 meter ladder is leaning against the wall. If the ladder forms an angle 
   of $\frac{1}{6} π$ with the ground, then what's the vertical height of the 
   ladder? What's the horizontal distance of the ladder?

2. Bob is trying to measure the height of a tall building. He walks about 20 
   meters away from the building and points a laser from the ground to edge of 
   the building's roof at an angle of $\frac{1}{3} π$. How tall is the building?

3. A drone is hovering 100 meters over flat desert ground. The drone spots a 
   campsite some distance away, and uses a laser to point at it. If the laser 
   forms a -60° angle from the horizontal plane in the sky, then how far away is 
   the campsite?

4. Alice is hiking up a trail with a slope of $\frac{1}{4} π$ from the ground. 
   If she's hiking at 10 meters per minute, then about how far up will she go in 
   10 minutes?
