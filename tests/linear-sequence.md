# Linear Sequences

## Abstract

Given this function $f$, describe the role of the constants $a$ and $b$.

$f(n) = an + b$

1. If you were to graph this function, what would happen as $a$ became smaller 
   or larger?
2. If you were to graph this function, what would happen as $b$ became smaller
   or larger?
3. What would happen to the graph if I multiplied all the results of $f$ by 
   $-1$?
4. What should I change to move the graph up or down and side to side?
5. If we are graphing the inputs and outputs of a function onto a 2-dimensional 
   graph, where the horizontal axis represented the inputs, and the vertical 
   axis represented the outputs, what sort of graph would we never expect to 
   see, and why?

## Applied

1. Write a generating function for each sequence below.

   * $-13, -10, -7, -4, -1, 2...$
   * $3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23...$
   * $23, 19, 15, 11, 7, 3...$

2. Write a function called $linearSum$ which can determine the sum of a finite 
   linear series $S$ given three inputs: (1) the first sequence item $S_0$, (2) 
   the last sequence item $S_F$, and (3) the number of sequence items $S_n$.
   Also provide an informal explanation for how you defined the function.

   $linearSum(S_0, S_F, S_n) =$
